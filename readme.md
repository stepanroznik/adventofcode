# Run each typescript solution using bun.

https://bun.sh/docs/installation

## example:

`bun run ./day-1/solution-1.ts`

No need to install or run anything (unless you don't have Bun on your PC yet)

Since it is forbidden by Advent of Code authors to upload my inputs here, you have to test each script on your own input. Simply add an `input.txt` file to each folder to run the solutions.
